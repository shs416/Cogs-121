# Project idea 1: My Vaccine
Our app is designed for people who have a hard time tracking what kind of vaccine they need based on their age, gender, and medical history. Unlike us, many people out there don’t schedule regular check-up with doctors and lack the knowledge of what kind of vaccines they need at the time. This app can help elderlies with low immune system make better health decision. This app can also help parents with newborns to better keep track of their kids’ vaccines records and schedules. 
We plan to use Google Map API to show users the nearby location that they can get the vaccine they needed. We also plan to use real life data sets with vaccines-related information to guide our users about what the vaccine is for and when it should be received. We also plan to incorporate News API to help the users to stay on current trends.
None of our teammates are a target audience for this app because none of us are parents.

# Project idea 2: DogMate
Dog owners/parents sometimes have difficulties finding the right partner for their dogs to breed. They are looking at factors like age, breed, locality, etc. for selecting a suitable partner for their dog. DogMate will serve as a database of eligible dogs around a certain locality based on your age/breed preference who are also looking to mate. 
We plan to use the Google Maps API to figure out distance between suitable matches which will help dog parents/owners determine if it is a feasible match.
None of our teammates are the target audience for the app because none of us are dog owners/parents.

*Possible Pivot*: An app for people to find adoptable pets and rescue them. We can use the [Adoptable Pet Data API](https://rescuegroups.org/services/adoptable-pet-data-api/) for that.

### Storyboards
#### Storyboard 1 (for vaccination app): 
The user does not know whether they are up to date on a certain vaccine, but with the web app, they can make sure they have that information on hand.

#### Storyboard 2 (for dog mating app):
A dog parent is specifically looking for a *female Beagle* to mate with for his dog Simba, but can't find one of suitable age. He uses the DogMate app to find a *female Beagle* of suitable age and within his locality.
