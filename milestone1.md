Project idea 1: My Vaccine
Our app is designed for people who have a hard time tracking what kind of vaccine they need based on their age, gender, and medical history. Unlike us, many people out there don’t schedule regular check-up with doctors and lack the knowledge of what kind of vaccines they need at the time. This app can help elderlies with low immune system make better health decision. This app can also help parents with newborns to better keep track of their kids’ vaccines records and schedules. 
We plan to use Google Map API to show users the nearby location that they can get the vaccine they needed. We also plan to use real life data sets with vaccines-related information to guide our users about what the vaccine is for and when it should be received. We also plan to incorporate News API to help the users to stay on current trends.

### Storyboards
Storyboard 1: Vaccine web application. The user does not know whether they are up to date on a certain vaccine, but with the web app, they can make sure they have that information on hand.
