# Milestone 2

We went with our initial Vaccines app idea with some minor changes. In essence, we plan to include the TA's feedback about having a news feed with alerts about recent outbreaks and general news regarding vaccines.

## Brief Description of the app idea (copied from Milestone 1):
Our app is designed for people who have a hard time tracking what kind of vaccine they need based on their age, gender, and medical history. Unlike us, many people out there don’t schedule regular check-up with doctors and lack the knowledge of what kind of vaccines they need at the time. This app can help elderly people with weak immune systems make better health decisions. This app can also help parents with newborns to better keep track of their kids’ vaccines records and schedules. We plan to use Google Map API to show users the nearby location that they can get the vaccine they needed. We also plan to use real life data sets with vaccines-related information to guide our users about what the vaccine is for and when it should be received. We also plan to incorporate News API to help the users to stay on current trends. None of our teammates are a target audience for this app because none of us are parents or elderly.
