# Milestone 2

After reviewing the feedback from the TA, we decided to go with the vaccine idea and narrow down our target users to parents with newborns. The app can help parents to keep track of their childrenâ€™s vaccine records and schedules. 



## App screenshots

For the design of our app, we decided to follow the general outline present in our prototype 1. For now, we choose to not include the map feature as there are already websites/apps existed that provide with similar functions and that we want to better focus on presenting the vaccine record information to our users.

The first screen put the users' vaccine records into two tables, pending vaccine and completed vaccine. Users can also edit, delete, or add the contents of the tables.

The second screen will include latest news related to vaccine information or health issue in the regions that we will fetch from News API.
