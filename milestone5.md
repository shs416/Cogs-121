## App Description

Having a newborn baby in the house is often overwhelming for the parents.
Besides making sure everything is fine at home for the baby, parents also 
need to take the baby to the doctor for vaccinations. With the crazy 
schedule, it's easy for parents to lose track. With Vacc Tracc, parents can 
easily track the kid's vaccine record as well as keep up with the newest infomation.
