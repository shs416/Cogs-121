### News Page

We updated the News page to make sure that every card and image is unified and aligned properly. 
We also delete the "LINK TO NEWS ARTICLE" part and replaced with the click-able news title 
that will take the users to the original news article

### Description

Having a newborn baby in the house is often overwhelming for the parents.
Besides making sure everything is fine at home for the baby, parents also need to take the baby 
to the doctor for vaccinations. With the crazy schedule, it's easy for parents to lose track. 
With Vacc Tracc, parents can easily track the kid's vaccine record as well as keep up with the 
newest infomation. 

### Data Visualization

For the data visualization, we implmented a timeline that retrive data 
from the database and shows the users the time length of each vaccine 
as most vaccines require muliple doeses.

### Possible Future Data Visualization Implementation 

In the future, we can potentially expend on the time line to not only 
shows the users the time range and does number of each vaccines but further
plan for the users when each shot of different vaccine should be taken based
on their schedule
